# Penny Drop Studios
## Description
We were tasked to create our own agency's website by implementing the things we learned during our first year.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Uses CSS3 and HTML5 latest features. Be sure to prefix any bleeding-edge rules, tags, etc (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/) for reference). Also using latest ES6/next, you should probably think about including [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for transpilation (or an NPM script).

### Installing

cd to the directory of your choice, clone, and hack away!
